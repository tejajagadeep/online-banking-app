### Example Database Schema

You might consider a simplified schema like the following:

1. **Users Table**

   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `username`
   - `password`
   - `role_id` (Foreign Key to Roles Table)

2. **Roles Table**

   - `role_id` (Primary Key)
   - `role_name` (e.g., Customer, Bank Teller, Administrator)

3. **Permissions Table**

   - `permission_id` (Primary Key)
   - `permission_name` (e.g., View Account, Process Transactions)

4. **Role_Permissions Table** (Mapping)
   - `role_id` (Foreign Key to Roles Table)
   - `permission_id` (Foreign Key to Permissions Table)
